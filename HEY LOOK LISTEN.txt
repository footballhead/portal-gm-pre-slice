This is the exact source code for       OO Portal GM Pre-Slice, which I released on YoYoGames.com  DU on May 20, 2008. This project was supposed to evolve    EL into a 2D top-down copy of Portal, incorporting Valve'sD elements plus my own. I actually got the portals        A  working sort of the way I want them too, and            CY established a couple connected systems, but never got   TO as far as I wanted.                                     IU                                                         V   None of the code is commented from what I know.        AC However, everything should be properly named and in a   TO state where it is functional. Anything that was in my   EM first release should be here including movement,        DE buttons, boxes, turrets, and anything else. Be aware    .  that since I only just opened the file, a couple bugsO are most likely still living in the file. Take care.    TV                                                         HE  The reason I am releasing the source is I am stopping  ER the project. Also, I believe different people find      R  different value in the same object, so someone might    EH have been scouring the interent for something likeE this. I don't really know if there are people like      YR this, but it is a possibilty. Since most of the         OE mechanics are working too someone might want to know    U? how to set up a box-button-door system and this has  that.                                                   AC                                                         RR  I hope that I haven't said too much or too little.     EI Regardless, go nuts with the source. I hope my hard     .T work helps you out in some way, shape, or form. If II can ask one thing, it is that if you use any portion of SC this file, please please PLEASE give me some credit.    HA One line in the endgame, that is all I am asking.       UL                                                         T   NO HARD FEELINGS.  WHO ARE YOU?  HELP. DISPENSING PRODUCTE                                                         IR History:                                                NR                                                         GO  Here is a bit of the history for the entire projectR for those who are interested. This story is one of epic D. failure so keep that in mind. I think the whole idea    O  came about early 2008 when I was young and stupid and   WW discovered Portal. I figured "Hey, I can make video     NH games, and I like Portal, why not make my own Portal?"  .O The project was born one night when I got a one-way' portal system coded and I became really enthusiastic.   DS                                                         E   This enthusiasm carried me for probably a good half    PT year and during that time I spewed out a few revised    LH editions (which were all on YoYoGames.com at one        OE point). However a problem quickly arose: my coding      YR style was growing along with the project. Great, I was  IE getting better, but I came to the realization that my   N? old code was broken. It eventually came to the point    G  that I could no longer make sense of what I had done,   .H what bugs existed, or how to fix them. The projectE started dieing.                                         FY                                                         I   After a unspecified chunk of time (I have no idea how  RH long), I became interested in the project again. I      IE don't know what got me motivated. I decided to start    NY from scratch. I redid all the sprites except two (I'll  G  let you guess which ones), re-coded everything, and     .H added a whole bunch of new junk. This effort evolvedE into Portal GM Edition Pre-Slice, and is what I call    EY the most complete version of the whole project.         X.                                                         C   I had every intention of turning this code into a full UP game. The base worked and I should have been able to    SU build on it. I didn't continue, however, and the        ET project died again. Eventually history repeated itself  I soon regained interest in the project. Obviously I    MM didn't learn from my other attempts. I think two or     EE three more attempts started to sprout and then died     .  from overwatering.D                                                         CO  Today, the project is dead. Sure, I would love to      AW finish this story with a happy ending, but it just      NN requires too much work. Two years have passed on a 2D. top-down game which should have been done in under a    I  year. I am now older and wiser and see that continuingN this just makes no sense. I still enjoy playing Portal, HA but now I have a much larger respect for what Valve has EP actually done and now eagerly await Portal 2.
